What option best describes the requirements we want for: ScienceTools, ST-User,
GlastRelease, The L1 pipeline, the code shared by all?

## Strict Dependence ##

1) All should always use the same shared code base. Changes that benefit ST but
break GR will not be permitted into ST. External dependency versions must be in
sync, and each product shall depend on the same version of shared FERMI code.

2) All should use the same shared FERMI code base, but external dependency
versions may change. Changes that benefit ST but break any other will not be
permitted into ST. External dependency versions may vary, but API's must be in
sync. If an API change breaks the some, but is required for another, all tools
should be updated to use it.

3)



## Strict Independence ##

All should be entirely independent of one another. Changes to
ST/Likelihood should be permitted if they do not break ST, but should have no
expectation of needing to work on GR. Maybe oneday they will be added to GR,
but it is not an immediate requirement.
